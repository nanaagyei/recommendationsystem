# Anime Recommendation system
A personal project on an anime recommendation system using cosine similarity. Before installing dependencies for the project, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for the project. We can do that by executing the following command in the terminal:

`python3 -m venv virtualenv`

This will create a virtual environment in the current directory you are in and name it _virtualenv_. After creating the virtual environment, we install the dependencies for the project. To do that, run the following command:

`pip install -r app/requirements.txt`

Since the `requirements.txt` is in the `app` directory, we will need to access that directory. 

Once this is complete, you can run the project by running `main.py` which will start the flask app.


This is the demo version. There will be more updates on the frontend using CSS and JavaScript.
#### Hope you enjoy!!!
